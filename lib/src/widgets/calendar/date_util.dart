  // 2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determination_of_the_day_of_the_week#Sakamoto's_methods
  // Explanation:
  // Although there are a plenty of methods to solve this question but one of the least known and most powerful method is **Tomohiko Sakamoto’s** Algorithm.
  // Jan 1st 1 AD is a Monday in Gregorian calendar.
  //Let us consider the first case in which we do not have leap years, hence total number of days in each year is 365.
  // January has 31 days i.e 7*4+3 days so the day on 1st feb will always be 3 days ahead of the day on 1st January.
  // Now february has 28 days(excluding leap years) which is exact multiple of 7 (7*4=28)
  // Hence there will be no change in the month of march and it will also be 3 days ahead of the day on 1st January of that respective year.
  // Considering this pattern, if we create an array of the leading number of days for each month then it will be given as t[] = {0, 3, 3, 6, 1, 4, 6, 2, 5, 0, 3, 5}.
  //Now let us look at the real case when there are leap years. Every 4 years, our calculation will gain one extra day.
  // Except every 100 years when it doesn’t. Except every 400 years when it does.
  // How do we put in these additional days? Well, just add y/4 – y/100 + y/400. Note that all division is integer division.
  // This adds exactly the required number of leap days.But here is a problem, the leap day is 29 Feb and not 0 January.
  // This means that the current year should not be counted for the leap day calculation for the first two months.
  // Suppose that if the month were January or February, we subtracted 1 from the year.
  // This means that during these months, the y/4 value would be that of the previous year and would not be counted.
  // If we subtract 1 from the t[] values of every month after February? That would fill the gap, and the leap year problem is solved.
  // hat is, we need to make the following changes:
  //    1.t[] now becomes {0, 3, 2, 5, 0, 3, 5, 1, 4, 6, 2, 4}.
  //    2.if m corresponds to Jan/Feb (that is, month<3) we decrement y by 1.
  //    3.the annual increment inside the modulus is now y + y/4 – y/100 + y/400 in place of y.
  int dayofweek(int d, int m, int y) {
    final t = [0, 3, 2, 5, 0, 3, 5, 1, 4, 6, 2, 4];
    y -= (m < 3) ? 1 : 0;
    return ((y + y ~/ 4 - y ~/ 100 + y ~/ 400 + t[m - 1] + d) % 7).toInt();
    //returns index of day wherein the week starts from Sunday, being 0.
